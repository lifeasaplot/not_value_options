# not_value_options

This is to help you find unusual stock options trades in the the US Options Market. 

For myself, I am an avid options market enthusiast and aspiring data scientist. 

I have left several filters in the code but will need to clean the code up for a final version. Any suggestions, comments, or tips are greatly appreciated!

I hope to gain a career opportunity working within python and programming. Thank you!
